			<h2 id="requirements">2.1 Requirements</h2>
			<p>In order to run the plugin smoothly you have to set your wordpress database execution time to be a number that is higher than 10 minutes (600+ seconds).
				<br>
				One way of setting this to add or edit the 
				<strong><em>set_time_timit</em></strong> in <strong><em>wp-config.php</em></strong> in the wordpress root folder.
			</p>

<pre class=" language-php"><code class="prism  language-php"><span class="token comment">//Setting max execute timer to be 900 seconds as mapping of data takes more than 30 seconds. </span>
<span class="token function">_set_time_limit</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">900</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>

			<p>If your web-host is blocks this by default then contact your hosting company so the data integrity can be maintained.</p>

			<h2 id="design">2.2 Design</h2>
			<p>Design is very minimal in this plugin as it is mainly aimed at making the import process easier for our clients.</p>
			<h4 id="step-01">Step 01:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are authentication fields where the details of the client are entered, this is confidential so keep it safe and secure. These authentication credentials are used to gain access to our API.</p>
			<h4 id="step-02">Step 02:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This step contains a button, when clicked, checks through your details and then imports and map the data into your wordpress database. The structure of the database depends on your choice on the step 01.</p>
			<h4 id="step-03">Step 03:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section contains a button called 
				<strong>
					<em>update properties</em>
				</strong> which on click will fetch all the properties which have been changed on the day and update them in the database.
